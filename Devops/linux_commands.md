* **scp** -> scp (secure copy) command in Linux system is used to copy file(s) between servers in a secure way. The SCP command or secure copy allows secure transferring of files in between the local host and the remote host or between two remote hosts. It uses the same authentication and security as it is used in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. SCP is known for its simplicity, security and pre-installed availability.

``` scp (directory address or file address in your local server) (destination-server: directory or file address)```

* **rsync** -> Remote Sync (Rsync) is the most commonly used command for copying and synchronizing files and directories remotely as well as locally in Linux/Unix systems.**Rsync** uses a remote-update protocol which allows transferring just the differences between two sets of files. The first time, it copies the whole content of a file or a directory from source to destination but from next time, it copies only the changed blocks and bytes to the destination.
