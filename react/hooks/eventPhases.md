In the context of the DOM event model, events can propagate through the DOM tree in two phases: the capturing phase and the bubbling phase. Understanding these phases is crucial for managing how events are handled in web development.

Capturing Phase
    During the capturing phase (also known as the "trickling phase"), the event starts from the root of the document and propagates down to the target element. In other words, the event is captured by the parent elements before it reaches the target element.



Bubbling Phase
    During the bubbling phase, the event starts from the target element and bubbles up to the root of the document. This means the event is first handled by the target element and then propagated to its parent elements and so on up to the root.


Now I have come across a very good example while on a project where I was working on a modal,I was trying to open the modal after I first closed it then it won't get open again so then I came across both these concepts.That when I got better understanding that,
Capturing phase is useful while working on closing a modal whenever a click happens outside the modal and you have pushed the modal just below the body element using "createPortal" otherwise bubbling phase would work in that scenario.
